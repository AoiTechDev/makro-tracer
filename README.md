# MealFulness
(Under development)

https://mealfulness.vercel.app/


## Project Overview
With this application, you can effortlessly monitor the nutritional composition of your meals on a daily basis. Moreover, it seamlessly integrates with an external API to provide you with detailed nutritional information for specific foods. Additionally, you have the option to customize your own ingredients and meals, making them reusable for future reference and sparing you the need to recreate and input meal information on a daily basis.

## Motivation - Why am I creating this app?
I became interested in understanding my daily nutritional intake when I returned to the gym. I wanted to monitor my meals to gauge the amount of protein and calories I was consuming. Additionally, some of my family members and friends expressed interest in using an app like this, but they couldn't find a free and satisfactory option. This motivated me to develop my own app that would cater to our specific requirements.
