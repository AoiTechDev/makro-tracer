# Macro Tracker Project Overview

## Project Functionality
Macro Tracker is a comprehensive application designed to empower users in tracking their daily meals and efficiently counting nutritional intake. The app offers a user-friendly interface that allows individuals to add their ingredients, complete with nutritional details. Users can seamlessly create meals by combining existing ingredients or incorporating new ones into their personalized database.

## API Connection
The app is intelligently connected to an external API containing vital nutritional information. This API integration ensures the accuracy and reliability of the nutritional data associated with each ingredient. Users can simply input the amount of a specific food item, and the app fetches precise nutrition information, enhancing the overall tracking experience.

## User Account Functionality
To provide a tailored experience, Macro Tracker incorporates a robust login/register functionality. This feature allows users to create accounts, log in, and uniquely track their daily meals. By having individual user accounts, Macro Tracker ensures that users can personalize their meal tracking journey, fostering a sense of ownership and consistency in their nutritional goals.

## Database Connection
Macro Tracker's seamless operation is supported by its connection to the Vercel PostgresSQL database. This integration serves as the backbone for storing all user-related information, including ingredient details, created meals, and user-specific nutrition logs. The Vercel PostgresSQL database guarantees data persistence, security, and efficient retrieval, contributing to a reliable and dynamic user experience.

Macro Tracker, with its intuitive design, API integration, user account functionality, and database connectivity, stands as a versatile tool for individuals seeking a precise and personalized approach to tracking their daily nutritional intake.
